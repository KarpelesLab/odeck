# odeck-10 — 10 Gbps prototype

First odeck build. Goal: a fully working, fully open USB-C deck assembled entirely by JLCPCB
(**JLC parts only, ≥ 5 in stock — no consignment**, decided 2026-10-02; check with `tools/bom_check.py`), validating everything the
later 20G/40G versions will reuse: power architecture, MCU/LCD firmware, card reader, 2.5GbE,
board outline and silkscreen style. Only the core and high-speed section change later.

Status: **planning** (updated 2026-10-02). Stock figures are JLC parts API / Mouser on 2026-10-02 —
re-check before ordering. Detailed research: `research/pd-controllers.md`, `research/hub-signal-path.md`,
`research/power-and-assembly.md`.

## Decisions (2026-10-02)
- Display out: **DP alt mode over the downstream USB-C** only (no full-size DP/HDMI on odeck-10).
- **2× USB-A 10G.** Hub ports: USB-A ×2, downstream C, GL3224, RTL8156BG on the 5× 10G ports; RP2350 on USB2.
- Board may grow beyond 100×60 mm if thermals need it; prototype carries extensive thermal instrumentation.
- **RP2350 is the update hub for every other programmable part.** Its firmware bundles images/configs for
  the other chips and flashes them on first boot and on updates.

## Firmware & update architecture
RP2350 firmware = its own code + a bundle of component images. On boot it compares versions and
(re)flashes as needed; updates ship as a single UF2 dropped onto the deck over USB.

| Component | Programmable storage | RP2350 path |
|---|---|---|
| PMG1-S3 (laptop + downstream PD) | internal flash | SWD (RP2350 as SWD probe, debugprobe-style) or PMG1 I2C bootloader |
| TPS26750 (PD-in) | I2C config EEPROM | RP2350 writes EEPROM (WP pin controlled) |
| USB7206C hub | ROM + runtime SMBus config; optional SPI flash | SMBus config at boot; SPI flash optional |
| GL3224 card reader | ROM; optional SPI flash | not needed initially |
| RTL8156BG | ROM; MAC in EEPROM/eFuse | **unique MAC** from a 24AA02E48/24AA025E48 EUI-48 EEPROM (C38987 / C129895) read by RP2350 and programmed into the PHY config |
| LCD | — | — |

**Safety trade-off:** if the RP2350 can reflash the PD controllers, a bad RP2350 firmware could too.
Hardware backstops that stay independent of *all* firmware:
- Independent hardware OVP on laptop VBUS (comparator + gate kill of the source switch above ~30 V), and
  source switch only enabled with buck-boost power-good.
- **No flash interlock** (decided 2026-10-02): prototypes are expendable. A default-closed solder jumper
  in the PMG1 SWD lines lets anyone who wants it cut the RP2350 off from the PD controller.

## Thermal & power instrumentation (prototype)
- **I2C temperature sensors** (TMP1075, C2870250, 38k stock, 8 addresses) at: buck-boost FETs/inductor,
  LM5148 5 V stage, USB7206C, PMG1/TUSB1064 area, laptop USB-C connector, RJ45/RTL8156, LCD, board edge/ambient.
  Plus a few NTC 0603 (NCP18XH103, C13564) on RP2350 ADC pins for hot spots too small for an SOIC/WSON.
- **Power monitors:** INA226 (36 V max, C49851) on laptop VBUS and 5 V rail; VIN (up to 48 V) needs an
  85 V part — INA237 (C2864837, pin-compatible with INA228/INA238).
- RP2350 logs everything over USB (CDC/serial or the status app) and shows it on the LCD; firmware
  derating policy is tuned from this data. Pads for external thermocouples on key spots.

## User buttons & forced 5 V charging
- **Two user buttons** on RP2350 GPIOs (in addition to BOOTSEL/reset); functions defined in firmware
  (e.g. button A: per-port "charge mode" toggle, button B: LCD page / select). Freely remappable.
- **Forced 5 V ("dumb charge") mode** per port, user-triggered: powers a port even when the device is
  non-compliant (USB-C device without Rd on CC, or no host attached to enumerate the hub).
  - USB-A: TPS2553 load switches (C55266, 58k stock) enabled by RP2350 (OR'd with hub PRTPWR), so ports
    can be powered with no laptop attached. Check USB7206C BC1.2 DCP/CDP + Apple/Samsung charging profiles.
  - Downstream USB-C: PMG1 port 1 sources 5 V without Rd on request from RP2350 (our PMG1 firmware;
    intentionally out-of-spec, user-initiated only).
- **Per-port power measurement:** shunt + INA180A2 (C192764, 99k stock, $0.19) per USB-A port into RP2350
  ADC; USB-C port via PMG1 integrated VBUS current sense (verify) or the same shunt + INA180 scheme.
- **Auto-off:** forced 5 V turns off after 5 min below a low-current threshold (~25 mA, tunable). Per-port
  watts shown on the LCD.

## Key design rules
- **Power safety independent of RP2350 firmware:** PD controllers boot autonomously; buck-boost voltage
  selected only by PD-controller GPIOs; buck-boost/power-path controls on a bus/pins the RP2350 can't reach.
- **Laptop-port direction:** source switch (to laptop) enabled only with external power + buck-boost
  power-good; sink switch (bus power → 5 V rail) enabled only with no external power. Back-to-back FETs,
  never both on. Live transitions via PR_Swap / Fast Role Swap.
- **Hub boot independent of RP2350:** hub SMBus pull-ups powered from an RP2350 GPIO, so in BOOTSEL /
  broken-firmware state the hub boots with defaults and UF2 recovery still works.
- **DP path:** TUSB1064 DP outputs → AC caps → TUSB1046 DP inputs; AUX AC-coupled between muxes;
  each PD port drives its own mux; HPD: monitor → port 1 → port 0 → laptop.

## Power & thermal
- Laptop: up to 140 W EPR, 100 W SPR fallback. Test host: MacBook Pro 16" M4 Max.
- Worst-case board dissipation **~12–14 W** → ~60–80 K rise on a bare 100×60 mm board. **Biggest risk.**
  Mitigations: temperature-based power derating by firmware (thermistors near buck-boost/hub),
  heavy copper + via arrays, optional bottom aluminium plate, or slightly larger board.

## Open questions
2. Does PMG1-S3 support PR_Swap / Fast Role Swap for bus-powered ↔ external-power transitions, and do
   Macs accept it? Alternative: accept a brief disconnect when external power is plugged/unplugged.
5. JLC: foam tape application for the LCD; low stock on RJ45 (111), TUSB1064 (73), USB7206C (26), PMG1 (50)
   → consign from Mouser/DigiKey.
6. Thermal budget vs board size — board may grow beyond 100×60; decide after prototype heat data.
7. Stackup: 6-layer standard likely enough for 10G; decide during layout.

## Cross-sheet integration items (from power sheet design)
1. **RTL8156BG needs an external 0.95 V rail** (internal-regulator BGS variant not stocked): regulator on the
   ethernet sheet (e.g. TLV62569 from +3V3, enabled by the PHY's POW_EXT_SWR pin).
2. **GL3224 runs from 5 V** (4.75–5.25 V): check +5V sag in bus-powered mode (sink switch drop).
3. **RAILS_PG** (open-drain, +1V15 good) should wire-OR onto HUB_RESET_N → MCU drives HUB_RESET_N open-drain;
   promote RAILS_PG to a global net when building usb_hub/mcu.
4. **LAPTOP_SNK_EN must work with a dead deck** (bus-powered cold start, no +3V3 yet): pd_pmg1 must drive it
   from VBUS-powered logic (PMG1 powered from laptop VBUS).
5. **PD-in TVS** (SMCJ51A, 82 V clamp at full surge) exceeds TPD4S480 VBUS abs max (63 V) — revisit clamp.
6. **Footprints to check before layout:** PJ-063BH (pad spacing mismatch found), XAL1010, HTSSOP-38 (LM51770),
   TPS25947, electrolytics, all easyeda imports.
7. **LM51770 compensation** needs simulation/Bode (shared VSEL RC node adds lag); LM74800 charge-pump start at
   5.1 V output to bench-check (or default 5.2 V). Full 140 W needs VIN ≳ 16 V.
8. **LM5148** at 8 A from 48 V ≈ 91 % (≈ 3.9 W) — ~1 W above budget; high-side FET is the hot spot.
9. TPS26750 boots in AlwaysEnableSink so the deck works with a blank EEPROM; draws from 5 V sources before a contract.

### From data-path sheets
10. **PMG1 CC pins are 6 V-rated** → laptop port CC/SBU behind TPD4S480 (EPR, dead-battery Rd enabled, powered
    from PMG1_VDDD; EPR_EN tied high — confirm with TI that permanent EPR mode is fine at low VBUS).
11. **PMG1 firmware duties:** GPIO-switched port-0 power path while still using PMG1 CSA (Infineon example uses
    the internal gate driver — confirm stack allows it); pulse mux CTL0 to power muxes down when unattached;
    advertise pin assignment D on the laptop port; forward IRQ_HPD; VBUS discharge after voltage step-downs.
12. **Hub port power pin is shared PRTPWR/OCS** → USBAx_PWR_EN and USBAx_OCS_N are one node (0 Ω joined);
    usb_a sheet must not add a pull-up there.
13. **MCU sheet:** no pull-ups on HUB_SMB_*; HUB_SMB_PU from a push-pull GPIO; HUB_RESET_N driven open-drain.
14. **AC coupling convention:** hub sheet caps all hub TX; device-side sheets cap their TX toward the hub
    (card_reader, ethernet, usb_a connectors per USB 3.x rules).
15. **Footprints to verify:** both USB-C receptacles (DX07 THT B-row numbering), PMG1 BGA-97 (0.5 mm), USB7206C VQFN-100.
16. Low stock: CYPM1321 (20), TUSB1046 (42), TUSB1064 (53), USB7206CT (21) — order the prototype run early.
17. Two linear redrivers in series at HBR3 — EQ is a first guess (both sides have bench-tunable strap footprints).

## Notes on a 20 Gbps step
USB 3.2 Gen2x2 (20G) is **not supported by Apple Silicon Macs** (they fall back to 10G), uses all 4
lanes (no DP alt mode at the same time), and essentially no Gen2x2 hub chips exist. A useful 20G step
would therefore be **USB4 at 20 Gbps**, which still needs a USB4 chip — same sourcing problem as 40G.

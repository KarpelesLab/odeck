# odeck-10 design review: MCU, display/UI and sensors

Reviewed on 2026-10-02 by an independent reviewer. This is a report only; no project files were changed.

**Scope.** The sheets `hardware/odeck-10/sheets/mcu.py`, `display_ui.py` and `sensors.py`, plus every MCU net where it
lands on another sheet: pd_pmg1, usb_hub, usb_a, ethernet, card_reader, power_input, power_laptop and power_rails.

**Method.**
- I dumped the netlist from the `.py` sources into scratch. Sheet `build()` was stubbed out, so no `.kicad_sch` file was
  written. I then traced every net that touches U1001 or U1003 across all sheets.
- I compared the result against the documents below. "DS" means the RP2350 datasheet and "HWD" means *Hardware design
  with RP2350*.
  - RP2350 DS: table 677 (GPIO functions), tables 1673–1679 (pins), table 1680 (absolute maximum ratings), §14.9 (IO DC
    characteristics), §6.3.8 (regulator) and appendix D (errata).
  - HWD §2–5.
  - Abracon AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T rev A.
  - TI TCA9534 (SCPS197).
  - TI TMP1075 (table 7-2, register map).
  - TI TPD4E02B04.
  - HS20HS072RX V1.0 (sections 2, 3.2 and 6).
  - ALPS SKRTLAE010 and XKB TS-1187A drawings.
  - Microchip USB7206C (PRT_DIS straps).
- I checked LCSC/JLC part values for all 33 MCU, UI and sensor part numbers through the JLC API. All of them match the
  schematic values.

No BLOCKER was found. Every GPIO peripheral assignment is possible on its pin, the I2C pull-ups are placed correctly, and
the dead-deck back-feed paths are handled (see "Verified OK" below).

### 1. MAJOR: the L1001 polarity-dot instruction is backwards (mcu)

**The defect.** Two places tell layout and assembly to put the dot toward VREG_LX:
- the L1001 description in `mcu.py:112`: "polarity dot toward VREG_LX (RPi: orientation matters)";
- `docs/design/mcu.md:32`: "Place it with the dot toward VREG_LX, as in the RPi layout".

**Evidence.**
- RP2350 DS Fig. 26 is the Pico 2 regulator layout, and RPi says to copy it exactly (§6.3.8.1, "at your own risk"
  otherwise).
  - It shows VREG_LX (pin 63 on QFN-80) routed to the *right* inductor pad.
  - The *orientation indicator* sits on the *left* pad, and that pad runs to C_OUT and the V_OUT/DVDD vias.
  - So the dot belongs on the **+1V1 (DVDD/COUT) side**, not on VREG_LX.
- The imported footprint already agrees with RPi. In `IND-SMD_L2.0-W1.6_AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T`, the silk dot at
  (0.90, −1.10) is next to pad 2, and pad 2 is +1V1 in the netlist (L1001.2). The netlist is therefore right and the
  instruction is wrong.
- Following the instruction would mean rotating the part 180° or swapping its pins. RPi says that degrades regulation
  under load and transients (DS §6.3.8.3).
- Caution: the Abracon datasheet's illustration (p.4) labels the dot terminal "+", which contradicts RPi Fig. 28. Treat
  the Pico 2 layout (Fig. 26) as the authority.

**Fix.**
- Change the L1001 description and mcu.md to "polarity dot on the +1V1/DVDD (C_OUT) pad, VREG_LX on the un-dotted pad
  (RP2350 DS Fig. 26)".
- Keep the current pin mapping (1 = VREG_LX, 2 = +1V1).
- Check the JLC CPL rotation against the footprint dot.
- Copy the inductor/capacitor geometry from the RPi minimal-board KiCad files (already listed as open issue 3).

### 2. MINOR: TCA9534 P7 floats, and the documented pull-downs on P6/P7 do not exist (mcu)

**Evidence.**
- `IOX_P7` is a single-pin net: U1003.12 only.
- mcu.md:113 and the mcu.py section 6 note both say "P6/P7 spare (10k PD)", but there is no such resistor. P6 is no
  longer spare either: it is ETH_I2C_EN, pulled down by 100k R820 on the ethernet sheet.
- TCA9534 DS §8.3.1: an input is high-impedance, and there are no internal pull-ups. Fig. 33 says unused pins "must be
  configured as outputs".

**Consequence.** Until firmware configures P7 as an output, the floating input causes:
- spurious `IOX_INT_N` interrupts (INT fires on any input edge, DS §8.3.2);
- extra ICC.
It also stays floating whenever the RP2350 is in BOOTSEL or running blank firmware.

**Fix.** Add a 10k pull-down (or pull-up) on IOX_P7. Correct the mcu.md P6/P7 row.

### 3. MINOR: backlight current can exceed the 80 mA absolute maximum (display_ui)

**Evidence.**
- HS20HS072RX §2: IF absolute maximum is 80 mA. §3.2: Vf is 2.8–3.2 V at 80 mA for 4 LEDs in parallel (20 mA × 4).
- R1101 is 33 Ω from +5V. The design worst case used 5.25 V.
- In bus-powered mode, +5V is laptop VBUS through the sink switch (power_rails note). vSafe5V may be up to 5.5 V.
  - (5.5 − 2.8) / 33 Ω = **82 mA**, before counting the lower Vf of hot LEDs.
- Normal external power gives +5V = 5.13 V, so (5.13 − 2.8) / 33 = 71 mA. That is fine.
- PWM dimming does not help, because the peak current is what matters.

**Fix.** Change R1101 to 39 Ω 1206.
- Typical (5.13 V, Vf 3.0 V): 55 mA.
- Worst case (5.5 V, Vf 2.8 V): 69 mA.
- Minimum (4.75 V, Vf 3.2 V): 40 mA.
If more margin is wanted, use 43 Ω.

### 4. MINOR: second COUT on DVDD missing (mcu)

**Evidence.** RP2350 DS §6.3.8.1: "In addition to C_OUT, for best performance we recommend a second 4.7 µF capacitor is
used on the V_OUT net, located on the bottom edge of the package (DVDD pin 23 on the QFN-60)". The QFN-80 equivalent of
that pin is DVDD pin 32, next to XIN/XOUT.

mcu.py has only C1002 (4.7 µF) plus 3 × 100 nF on +1V1.

**Fix.** Add a 4.7 µF 0402 (C23733) on +1V1 at pin 32. Keep it away from L1001/C_OUT, as the datasheet says.

### 5. MINOR: the PHY I2C bridge can lock up I2C_SYS and the expander that controls it (mcu + ethernet)

**The setup.**
- `ETH_I2C_EN` (U1003 P6) drives the gates of the 2N7002DW bridge (Q801).
- `ETH_RESET_N` (U1003 P5) switches ETH_3V3 through U802. U802 has QOD, so ETH_3V3 is discharged to 0 V when off.
- The PHY-side pull-ups (R818/R819, 4.7k) go to ETH_3V3.
- ethernet.py notes "enable only while ETH_3V3 is on". Nothing enforces this in hardware.

**The failure.**
- Suppose P6 is high while P5 is low. That happens with a firmware bug, or with the thermal-derating path that powers
  the PHY down while a MAC write is in progress.
- Then I2C_SYS_SDA/SCL are pulled through the conducting FET channels into the unpowered PHY pins and pull-ups.
- This loads I2C_SYS toward the low or undefined region:
  - with the 2.2k bus pull-up against the 4.7k to 0 V, the bus sits at about 2.25 V, which is below VIH = 2.31 V;
  - the PHY's own ESD clamps to its dead rail pull it lower still.
- The TCA9534 that would clear P6 sits on that same I2C_SYS. It has no reset pin, so I2C_SYS stays dead until a full
  power cycle.

**Fix**, preferably in hardware: only allow the gate drive when ETH_3V3 is up.
- Option A: feed the Q801 gates from ETH_I2C_EN through a series resistor, with a small N-FET pulling the gates low when
  ETH_3V3 is absent.
- Option B: take the gate drive from ETH_3V3 through a P6-controlled switch.

As a minimum, firmware must clear P6 before any write that drives P5 low.

### 6. MINOR: PMG1 reset/flash on bus power cuts the deck's supply (mcu / pd_pmg1)

**Evidence.**
- In bus-powered mode, +5V and +3V3 exist only because PMG1 P0.0 drives LAPTOP_SNK_EN (power_laptop: SNK_ON =
  LAPTOP_SNK_EN 10k/47k ...).
- The RP2350 can assert PMG1_XRES_N (GPIO28, then JP401 and the pass FET Q401) and reflash the PMG1 over SWD.
- Once the PMG1 is in reset, its GPIOs go Hi-Z: LAPTOP_SNK_EN drops, the deck loses +3V3, and the RP2350 browns out in
  the middle of the flash.
- The PMG1 is then left with a corrupt image. It is only recoverable with external power, because a bus-powered start
  needs working PMG1 firmware.

**Fix.**
- Document it as a requirement: firmware must only toggle PMG1_XRES_N or start a PMG1 SWD session when EXT_PWR_PRESENT = 1
  (TCA9534 P0).
- Add it to pd_pmg1.md / mcu.md "Firmware notes".
- The PMG1 I2C bootloader path has the same constraint.

### 7. NOTE: PMG1 SWD pull-ups into the unpowered RP2350 (mcu / pd_pmg1)

**Evidence.**
- In a dead-deck start, PMG1 VDDIO = PMG1_VDDD = 3.0–3.65 V (from the VBUS regulator, pd_pmg1 note).
- The PMG1 SWD pull-ups (~5.6k) drive GPIO26/27 directly through JP402/JP403.
- RP2350 DS table 1673/1680: an FT pad with IOVDD = 0 is specified to "very little current … below 3.63 V".
- So at the top of the VDDD range this is marginally out of spec. The source impedance is high (5.6k) and the likely
  current is µA-level, so the practical risk is low.

**Fix (optional).** Fit 1k series resistors in PMG1_SWDIO/SWCLK on the mcu side. This is harmless for SWD at ≤ 10 MHz.

### 8. NOTE: LCD supply at 3.33 V (display_ui)

**Evidence.** HS20HS072RX §3.1 gives a recommended maximum of 3.3 V for both VCI and IOVCC; the absolute maximum is
4.6 V. +3V3 is set to 3.33 V (power_rails RFBT/RFBB = 31.6k/10k), so it is up to about 3.36 V with resistor tolerance.

This is only marginally out of the recommended range, and is common practice.

**Fix.** Accept it and record it as a known deviation. Alternatively, retrim +3V3 to 3.30 V; the RP2350 accepts
3.135–3.63 V, so it would not care.

### 9. NOTE: the user-header capability claims are wrong (display_ui.py:127, display_ui.md:107-108)

**What the docs claim.** "UART0 (12/13), SPI1 (12–15), SPI0 (16–19), I2C0/I2C1 on every pair" is listed as available.

**What is actually free.** Checked against DS table 677 and the GPIO allocation:
- I2C0 is I2C_PD (GPIO4/5) and I2C1 is I2C_SYS (GPIO2/3), so neither controller is free.
- UART0 is the debug console (GPIO0/1).
- SPI0 is the LCD (GPIO20–23).
- The genuinely free hardware for the header is SPI1 (12–15), PWM slices 6/7/0/1, HSTX, and the third PIO block.

**HSTX "DVI!".** DVI breakouts drive TMDS through their own ~270 Ω resistors. The added 220 Ω series resistors (R1106–
R1113) and the TVS capacitance make DVI unlikely to work.

**Fix.** Correct the silkscreen/back-side table text before it is drawn. Either drop "DVI" or fit 0 Ω/DNP options for
R1106–R1113.

### 10. NOTE: the "swap buses" claim for GPIO8/9 and GPIO30/31 (mcu.py section 5 note, mcu.md "Firmware notes")

DS table 677: GPIO8/9 map to I2C0, and GPIO30/31 map to I2C1. Those are the same controllers as I2C_PD and I2C_SYS.

A swap is therefore only possible by giving up the other bus. The PIO assignment itself is feasible:
- PIO0 at GPIOBASE 0 can host the SMBus (8/9), SWD (26/27) and Qwiic (30/31);
- PIO1 at GPIOBASE 16 can host the LED counters (36–39);
- PIO2 stays free.

**Fix.** Reword the note.

### 11. NOTE: header protection details (display_ui)

**The "5 V tolerant while powered" claim** (display_ui.md and the sheet note).
- The FT pads do allow 5.5 V with IOVDD up.
- But TPD4E02B04 VRWM is 3.6 V and VBRF is 5.5 V minimum. Leakage at 5 V is unspecified, though VHOLD = 5.8 V means a 5 V
  source cannot hold the clamp in snapback.
- Specify the header as 3.3 V logic and treat 5 V as abuse, not a feature.

**HDR_A0/A1 back-power risk.**
- 1k into non-FT pads: a user's 3.3 V source applied with the deck off pushes about 2.7 mA through the GPIO44/45 clamp
  into the whole +3V3 rail.
- Optional fix: 10k series plus 10 nF at the pin, as already done for ISENSE.

### 12. NOTE: TMP1075 does support SMBus Alert Response (sensors)

**Evidence.**
- sensors.md and sensors.py say "ALERT has no per-device flag (LM75-style), so the ISR reads all 8".
- TMP1075 DS §7.3.2.6 says otherwise: in interrupt mode (TM = 1), the devices answer ARA (0x0C) with their address.
  Arbitration clears one device at a time.
- 0x0C is free on I2C_SYS.

The power-on default is comparator mode (config 00FFh), which keeps the blank-firmware 80 °C flag. Firmware could
switch to TM = 1 after boot.

**Fix.** Correct the doc. This is optional and has no hardware impact.

### 13. NOTE: RP2350 erratum E9

**Evidence.** RP2350-E9 is the pad pull-down that fails to pull a pin low after it was driven high with input enabled.
DS appendix D.5.1 lists it as affecting **A2 only**.

The design relies on internal pull-downs in several places:
- LCD_RST_N and LCD_CS_N have no external resistor;
- FORCE_EN, SMB_PU and the backlight gate have 100k externally, which E9 would overpower on A2 silicon.

**Fix.** Confirm that the JLC/LCSC stock (C42415655) is A3/A4, using the marking or CHIP_ID.REVISION on the first
articles.

### 14. NOTE: documentation and netlist mismatches

| Location | What is wrong | Correct value |
|---|---|---|
| mcu.md:76–77 | LCD series resistors listed as R1024/R1025 | They are **R1022/R1023**. R1025 is the status-LED 1k |
| mcu.md:130 | ISENSE 10k listed as R1019/R1021 | They are **R1018/R1019**. R1020/R1021 are the NTC bias |
| mcu.py section 7 note, mcu.md "Requirements on other sheets" 2 | They still discuss an INA180 powered from +5V | usb_a already powers the INA180s (U703, U706) from +3V3 (and adds 1k/100 nF). The 10k series is now just a second RC stage |
| ethernet.py:245 | R820 description: "its 10k PD also holds it off" | No 10k pull-down exists on the mcu side (see finding 2) |
| card_reader.py section 5 note | Says the RP2350 taps the card-detect nodes, and "internal pulls OFF" | CR_CD_SD_N/USD_N go to **TCA9534 P3/P4**, which has no pulls at all. The circuit is fine; only the note is wrong |

### 15. NOTE: RTL8156BG slave address on I2C_SYS

While ETH_I2C_EN is high, the PHY's I2C slave is on I2C_SYS, and its address is "not in the DS" (ethernet.py).

It must not collide with any address already used on I2C_SYS:
- 0x20 (TCA9534);
- 0x41/0x44/0x45 (INA);
- 0x48–0x4F (TMP1075);
- 0x50 (EUI EEPROM);
- 0x0C (ARA, if finding 12 is adopted).

**Fix.** Bench-scan the PHY address with the other devices isolated, before relying on the eFuse write.

## Verified OK (no action)

**Pinout and symbol.**
- RP2350B: the symbol pin numbers match DS table 1674/1679 for QFN-80:
  - IOVDD 5/15/24/29/41/50/60/76;
  - DVDD 10/32/51;
  - VREG 61–65, USB 66/67, USB_OTP_VDD 68, QSPI 69–75, ADC_AVDD 59, EP 81.
- The `GPIOn_ADCm` pin names for 40–47 are correct.

**GPIO feasibility (DS table 677).**

| Function | Pins |
|---|---|
| UART0 TX/RX | GPIO0/1 |
| I2C1 | GPIO2/3 |
| I2C0 | GPIO4/5 |
| SPI0 RX/CSn/SCK/TX | GPIO20/21/22/23 |
| PWM4 B | GPIO25 |
| PWM11 B | GPIO47 |
| HSTX | GPIO12–19 |
| ADC0–7 | GPIO40–47 |

- The FT pins are GPIO0–39, SWD and RUN (≤ 3.63 V while unpowered).
- The non-FT pins are GPIO40–47 (max IOVDD + 0.5 V).

**RP2350 support circuit.**
- It matches HWD/DS:
  - 3.3 µH AOTA inductor;
  - C_IN/C_OUT/VREG_AVDD 4.7 µF;
  - 33 Ω VREG_AVDD filter;
  - VREG_FB to DVDD;
  - ABM8-272-T3 crystal with 2 × 15 pF and a 1k XOUT resistor (Crystal_GND24 pin 1/3 = crystal, 2/4 = GND, matching
    the ABM8);
  - W25Q128JVSIQ pinout, SD0 → DI, SD1 → DO;
  - QSPI_SS 10k DNP plus 1k to BOOTSEL;
  - 27 Ω USB series resistors to hub port 6;
  - 1k on RUN against the internal pull-up (about 0.1 V when pressed).
- TS-1187A A-B / C-D pairs are joined, and footprint pads 1/2 (A/B) sit on the same side.
- SKRTLAE010: pins 1/3 are common and pin 2 is the contact, per the ALPS circuit diagram.

**I2C pull-ups: exactly one set per bus.**

| Bus | Pull-ups | Location |
|---|---|---|
| I2C_SYS | R1009/R1010 | only (the bridge adds PHY-side 4.7k only while enabled; 2.2 mA, OK) |
| I2C_PD | R1011/R1012 | only |
| I2C_EXT | R1013/R1014 | only |
| Hub SMBus | none on mcu | R627/R628 to HUB_SMB_PU, with 100k R629 on usb_hub |

- I2C_SYS capacitance is estimated at ≤ 130 pF, giving tr ≈ 240 ns at 2.2k, which is within 300 ns.

**Drive types.**
- HUB_SMB_PU is push-pull with 100k PD.
- HUB_RESET_N is open-drain emulation with a 10k PU and the RAILS_PG Schottky OR. With the RP2350 in reset it sits at
  ≥ 2.58 V (10k against the 36k minimum pull-down).
- PMG1_XRES_N goes through the gate=+3V3 pass FET with 10k on the RP2350 side. It is isolated in a dead deck, and the
  body diode is reverse-biased.
- ETH_RESET_N is a TCA9534 push-pull output with 10k PU. The power-on input state means the PHY is on.
- USBA1/2_FORCE_EN are push-pull with 100k PD on usb_a.

**Dead-deck sources.**
- PDIN_PRESENT: 1k into FT GPIO29.
- CR_LED: 1k, GL3224 3.3 V, into FT GPIO39.
- ETH_LED0..2: buffered on +3V3.
- I2C_PD and both IRQs: pull-ups on +3V3, so they idle at 0 V.
- ISENSE: INA180 is on +3V3, plus 1k + 10k series.
- NTC: biased from ADC_AVDD.
- IOX_INT_N: pulled to +3V3.
- EXT_PWR_PRESENT, LAPTOP_OVP_N, TEMP_ALERT_N and CR_CD_*: all on TCA9534 inputs, which are high-Z and 5.5 V tolerant.

**Single pull-ups.**
- TEMP_ALERT_N has only R1016.
- TCA9534 address 0x20 (A2..A0 = 000) is free on I2C_SYS.
- TCA9534 TSSOP-16 symbol pinout is correct.

**Sensors.**
- TMP1075 straps decode to 0x48–0x4F (DS table 7-2), with no conflict against INA 0x41/0x44/0x45 (straps checked on
  power_rails, power_laptop and power_input), TCA9534 0x20 or EEPROM 0x50.
- TMP1075 DSG pinout is correct.
- TMP1075 defaults: config 00FFh, TLOW 75 °C, THIGH 80 °C.

**LCD.**
- FPC pinout matches HS20HS072RX §6: 1 GND, 2 CS, 3 RS, 4 SCL, 5 SDA, 6 RST, 7 NC, 8 IOVCC, 9 VCI, 10 A, 11 K, 12 GND.
- The interface is 4-wire SPI with no IM straps.
- The backlight is 4 LEDs in parallel with separate A/K pins, so the low-side AO3400A switch is valid. Gate PD 100k.

**Qwiic and header protection.**
- Qwiic pinout: 1 GND, 2 3V3, 3 SDA, 4 SCL.
- The header has 220 Ω + ESD on GPIO and 1k + ESD on ADC, plus PTC-fused 5V/3V3.
- Qwiic has ESD at the connector.
- Hub port 6 PRT_DIS strap: both DP and DM must be high to disable the port, so the RP2350's FS pull-up on DP alone
  cannot disable it.

## Resolution

Applied on 2026-10-02 to `mcu.py`, `display_ui.py`, `sensors.py` and `docs/design/mcu.md`, `display_ui.md`, `sensors.md`.
`build_all.py mcu display_ui sensors` gives "netlist verify: OK" and `tools/bom_check.py` gives 0 failing. New parts were
created at the end of each `build()`, so no existing reference designator moved.

| # | Status | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Fixed** (text) | The L1001 description, a new section-2 sheet note and mcu.md now say: polarity dot on the +1V1/DVDD (C_OUT) pad 2, VREG_LX on the un-dotted pad 1 (RP2350 DS Fig. 26). Pin mapping unchanged (1 = VREG_LX, 2 = +1V1), matching the footprint dot. Added a placement note: verify the JLC CPL rotation in the placement preview so the dot lands on pad 2. mcu.md open issue 3 updated. |
| 2 | **Fixed** | Added **R1028** 10k from IOX_P7 to GND. The mcu.py note and the mcu.md expander table now show P6 = ETH_I2C_EN (output, 100k pull-down R820 on the ethernet sheet, none here) and P7 = spare with 10k PD; firmware rule I1 sets P7 as output low. The stale R820 description on ethernet.py ("its 10k PD also holds it off") belongs to the ethernet owner. |
| 3 | **Fixed** | R1101 33 Ω → **39 Ω 1 % 1206, C22198** (UNI-ROYAL 1206W4F390JT5E, 94k in stock). Worst case at +5V = 5.5 V, Vf 2.8 V: 69 mA (72 mA at Vf 2.7 V), under 80 mA. Typical at 5.13 V, Vf 3.0 V: 55 mA. Minimum at 4.75 V, Vf 3.2 V: 40 mA. Dissipation ≤ 0.19 W. Sheet note and display_ui.md updated. |
| 4 | **Fixed** | Added **C1028** 4.7 µF 0402 (C23733) on +1V1, described and noted as "at DVDD pin 32, bottom edge, away from L1001/C_OUT". |
| 5 | Not handled here | Ethernet-sheet fix by another agent. The firmware minimum (clear P6 before P5 low) is firmware rule E2 in mcu.md. |
| 6 | **Fixed** (doc + sheet note) | Rule M1 in the new mcu.md "Firmware rules" section: never assert PMG1_XRES_N, start PMG1 SWD or use the PMG1 I2C bootloader unless EXT_PWR_PRESENT = 1. It is also in the GPIO table (GPIO26–28), mcu.md "Firmware notes", the section-3 note and a new section-11 "Firmware rules" note on mcu.py. pd_pmg1.md is owned by another agent; it should reference M1. |
| 7 | **Fixed** | Added **R1026/R1027** 1k in series between GPIO26/27 and PMG1_SWCLK/SWDIO (GPIO nets renamed MCU_PMG1_SWCLK/SWDIO, local). The global nets are unchanged. |
| 8 | Accepted (documented) | Recorded as a known deviation in the display_ui.py LCD note and display_ui.md: +3V3 = 3.33 V nominal against the 3.3 V recommended maximum, with retrimming as an option. |
| 9 | **Fixed** (text) | The header note and display_ui.md now list only the free functions (SPI1, PWM6/7/0/1, PIO2, HSTX). They state that UART0, SPI0, I2C0 and I2C1 are in use and that HSTX is not DVI-capable behind 220 Ω + ESD (do not print "DVI"). mcu.md GPIO12 row is fixed too. |
| 10 | **Fixed** (text) | The mcu.py section-5 note, the GPIO8/30 rows and mcu.md "Firmware notes" now say that GPIO8/9 = I2C0 and GPIO30/31 = I2C1, the controllers already used, so a swap costs the other bus. The PIO0/PIO1/PIO2 budget is added. |
| 11 | **Fixed** | The header is documented as 3.3 V logic, with 5 V treated as abuse. HDR_ADC0/1 series resistors R1114/R1115 1k → **10k**, plus **C1108/C1109** 10 nF at the RP2350 side. Back-power into GPIO44/45 drops from ~2.7 mA to ~0.3 mA. |
| 12 | **Fixed** (text) | The sensors.py note and sensors.md now describe the ARA (0x0C, TM = 1 after boot) as an option next to reading all 8. 0x0C is added to the I2C_SYS map. Firmware rule I3. |
| 13 | Open (bring-up) | Stepping cannot be confirmed from the JLC API. mcu.md now has a stepping/E9 paragraph, open issue 6 and firmware rule I7: read CHIP_ID.REVISION; on A2, drive pull-down-dependent pins low before releasing them, and switch R629/R702/R707 to 4.7k (data review #4, other sheets). |
| 14 | **Fixed** for owned files | mcu.md: LCD series resistors are R1022/R1023, ISENSE 10k are R1018/R1019, the INA180 text matches usb_a (+3V3, 1k/100 nF; requirement 2 marked done), and the card-detect text points to TCA9534 P3/P4. The mcu.py section-7 note is reworded. The ethernet.py R820 description and the card_reader.py section-5 note belong to other owners and are still open. |
| 15 | Documented | Firmware rule E3 (bench-scan the PHY address against 0x0C/0x20/0x41/0x44/0x45/0x48–0x4F/0x50 before the eFuse write), mcu.md open issue 7, and the sensors.md I2C map. |

Also: display_ui.md's footprint paragraph now matches the reworked `LCD_FPC_Solder_12P_P0.50mm` (footprint review 1, item 12):
0.3 × 4.75 mm lands, pin 1 at −X with the exit edge at +Y, a 180° fold, and hot-bar or pre-tinning through the stiffener.
mcu.md also gained a "Firmware rules" section, which collects every firmware constraint from `docs/design/*.md` and
`docs/review/*.md` and is the seed of the firmware spec.

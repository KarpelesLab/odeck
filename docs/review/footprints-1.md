# Footprint review 1/2 — entries [1]–[27] (odeck-10)

Scope: the custom footprints in `hardware/lib/odeck.pretty` listed as [1]–[27] in the footprint inventory
(the other half is in `footprints-2.md`). For each one I compared pad count, pad numbers against the symbol pin
numbers (`hardware/lib/odeck.kicad_sym`), pitch, pad size, row spacing, EP size and paste, drills, pin‑1
orientation and courtyard with the manufacturer drawing. All 27 files load in pcbnew and
`kicad-cli fp upgrade` runs on them cleanly. Every symbol pin number has a pad, and the only pads without a
symbol pin are unnumbered paste apertures and NPTH holes.

**One problem affects the whole set:** every EasyEDA import had its courtyard drawn as the body outline,
leaving pads outside it (25/27 failed). All courtyards now cover pads + body + 0.25 mm (0.5 mm for the RJ45).
Large exposed pads that had 100 % paste now use segmented apertures.

**No footprint reassignments are needed.** Every part matches its footprint after the fixes below, including
the parts that share a footprint.

| # | Footprint | Part(s) | Status | Notes / reference |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | BGA-97_L6.0-W6.0-P0.50-TL_CYPD8225-97BZXIT | CYPM1321-97BZXI (U401) | **OK** | Infineon PMG1-S3 DS 002-31288 Rev *K, Fig.14 (BZ97A, PG-VFBGA-97): this is a non-uniform grid (outer ring 11×11 @0.50, inner 5×5 @0.65, ring‑to‑inner 0.70, D1 5.00). All 97 ball positions match, A1 is top-left, and all 97 ball names match the Fig.8 ballmap and the symbol. Pads are 0.24 mm NSMD for a 0.30 mm ball. The "CYPD8225" in the name is cosmetic. |
| 2 | CAP-SMD_BD10.0-L10.3-W10.3-LS10.8-FD | RVT 100µ/80V (C122, C123) | **FIXED** | The pads were 4.5×1.65 at ±4.5, so a terminal (C=11.1, P=4.5) barely landed on its pad and the pads stuck out of the courtyard. Replaced with KiCad `CP_Elec_10x10.5` (pads 4.4×2.5, gap 4.0), which matches the KNSCHA RVT spec "Recommended land" for Ø10 (X 2.5, Y 4.0, a 4.0). Pad 1 = + (chamfered side), which matches symbol pin 1 = VIN. |
| 3 | CONN-SMD_4P-P1.00_SM04B-SRSS-TB-LF-SN | QWIIC (J1102) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | Pads match JST SH SM04B-SRSS-TB and KiCad `JST_SH_SM04B-SRSS-TB` (0.6×1.55 @1.0, MP 1.2×1.8 at ±2.8, 3.875 row offset; this one uses 3.88). Converted from the legacy `module` format. |
| 4 | DC-IN_PJ-063BH | PJ-063BH (J102) | **FIXED** (pads, courtyard) | The reported pad spacing mismatch is not a real error. The Same Sky DS (10/20/2022) gives distances **from the panel edge**: hole 3.0, MS 5.0, pin 2 6.0, pin 1 12.0. Relative to the Ø1.6 hole that is 2.0 / 3.0 / 9.0, which is exactly what the footprint has. Slot sizes are correct (pin 1 3.0×1.0, pin 2 2.3×1.0, MS 1.0×2.5, 9.0 apart). Pads enlarged to give ≥0.4 mm annular ring (8 A), the silk was trimmed, and the courtyard now reaches the front edge. |
| 5 | DFN-8_L5.9-W5.2-P1.27-LS6.2-BL | BSC0901NS (Q303) | **FIXED** | Regenerated to the Infineon PG-TDSON-8 "recommended board pads & apertures" (BSC040N08NS5 DS Rev 2.1 Fig.3): S/G pads 0.5×0.925 at y 2.863, drain pins 0.6×0.8, drain pad 4.41 wide reaching 4.455 from the pin tips, and the 2×2 paste split (1.6×1.5). The old source/drain gap was 1.03 mm instead of 1.27 and the pads were undersized. EP = pad 9 (the symbol has 9 pins). |
| 6 | HTSSOP-38_L9.7-W4.4-P0.50-LS6.4-BL-EP | LM51770 (U201) | **FIXED** | TI DCP0038A (LM51770 DS SNVSCL2A p.63-65): pads 1.5×0.3 on 5.8 mm rows (the old ones were 1.715 long on 5.72), EP 4.7×2.9 with a 1:1 paste opening per the 0.125 mm stencil table. Pin 1 is bottom-left and the symbol pins 1–39 match. |
| 7 | IND-SMD_L11.3-W10.0_XAL1010-332ME | XAL1010-103MED (L201) | **OK** | Coilcraft XAL1010 Doc 804: land 2.38 wide on 6.65 centres, length B = 8.91 for -103. The footprint has 2.4 × 9.0 on 6.66, so it suits -103 even though the name says -332. The courtyard was already OK. Nothing changed. |
| 8 | IND-SMD_L13.45-W12.6 | MWSA1206S-4R7MT (L301) | **FIXED** | Sunlord MWSA-S spec Table 4-1: I=3.25, J=8.0 gap, H=5.5. The old pads (3.0×6.0, gap 9.0) overlapped the 2.0 mm terminals by only about 0.2 mm. New pads 3.25×5.5 at ±5.625, courtyard fixed. |
| 9 | IND-SMD_L2.0-W1.6_AOTA-B201610S3R3-101-T | AOTA-B201610S3R3 (L1001) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | The pads match the Abracon recommended land (1.0×1.6, gap 1.0). Converted from the legacy format. If the RP2350 EMI guidance on winding direction matters, orient the polarity dot during layout. |
| 10 | IND-SMD_L5.4-W5.2 | MWSA0503S-1R5/-2R2 (L302, L303) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | The pads already match Sunlord Table 4-1 (I 1.9, J 2.2, H 2.5) for both parts. |
| 11 | KEY-SMD_SKRTLAE010 | SKRTLAE010 (SW1101/2) | **FIXED** | Alps SKRT land dimensions: the pad positions and sizes were correct. The two Ø0.9 guide-boss holes were *plated* holes with zero annular ring; they are now NPTH. Added the body/button fab outline, the "no copper" area between pads 4/5 (Dwgs.User) and a courtyard covering the button. Converted from the legacy format. |
| 12 | LCD_FPC_Solder_12P_P0.50mm | HS20HS072RX (U1101) | **FIXED** (reworked) | Hansheng HS20HS072RX drawing p.10: 12 contacts @0.5, 3.5 mm exposed, tail 6.5 wide, 5 mm stiffener on the back. The contacts are on the panel's front side, so the tail has to be folded 180° under the panel (stated in the descr). With the panel-exit edge at +Y, pin 1 is at −X. The lands are now 0.3×4.75 and run 1.25 mm past the tail end so a hot-bar or iron can reach the joint. Added the tail/stiffener outline on F.Fab and silk alignment ticks, plus the LCSC property. The pin map matches the symbol (1 GND … 12 GND). **Check the fold direction against the mechanical stack-up.** This is a ZIF-style stiffened tail: the soldered joint is behind a 0.2–0.3 mm stiffener, so use hot-bar or pre-tin the lands. A 12P 0.5 mm FPC connector would be the safer choice. **Outcome (2026-10-02): REPLACED.** Following a project-lead decision, the panel now plugs into J1103 Hirose FH34SRJ-12S-0.5SH (C424659). That part is dual contact, 1.0 mm high, takes 0.3 mm FPC, and sits under the panel 14.5 mm inside the tail edge. Its footprint `FFC-SMD_12P-P0.50_FH34SRJ-12S-0.5SH` was corrected to the Hirose pattern: pads 0.3×0.8, tabs 0.4×0.8, E/F 7.1/7.9, 3.3 overall, and a new courtyard. The fold maps panel pin n to J pin 13−n, and the schematic is wired that way. U1101 is DNP and uses the pad-less `LCD_HS20HS072RX_Outline`. This footprint was deleted. See display_ui.md. |
| 13 | MSOP-10_L3.0-W3.0-P0.50-LS5.0-BL | INA226 (U204, U303) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | TI DGS0010A example land is 1.45×0.3 on 4.4. The footprint has 1.62×0.28 on 4.22 with the same outer edge, which is acceptable. |
| 14 | PG-TDSON-8_L5.0-W6.0-P1.27-BL-EP | BSC026N08NS5 (Q104–Q107) | **FIXED** | Same Infineon TDSON-8 land as #5 (BSC026N08NS5 DS Rev 2.3 outline PG-TDSON-8-U08 matches). The EP is numbered 8, as the symbol has 8 pins. |
| 15 | PG-TDSON-8_L5.2-W5.9-P1.27-LS6.2-BL-EP | BSC0805LS (Q201, Q202, Q302) | **FIXED** | Same land as #5. EP = pad 9 (symbol pin "EP"). |
| 16 | PG-TDSON-8_L5.9-W5.1-P1.27-LS6.2-BL | BSC040N08NS5 (Q213, Q214) | **FIXED** | Same land as #5 (this is the datasheet the Infineon land comes from). EP = pad 8. |
| 17 | PG-TSDSON-8_L3.3-W3.3-P0.65-BL-1 | BSZ070N08LS5 (Q301) | **FIXED** | PG-TSDSON-8 FL per BSZ070N08LS5 DS Rev 2.2 Fig.1 (F1 3.90, F2 2.29, F3 0.31, F6 1.00, F7 2.51, F8 1.64): fused 1.64 mm source bar for pins 1–3, separate gate, drain pad with pin fingers, 0.39 S–D gap (it was 0.54) and reduced paste. EP = pad 8. |
| 18 | QFN-32_L4.0-W4.0-P0.40-BL-EP2.8 | TPS26750 (U102) | **FIXED** | TI RSM0032B (TPS26750 DS p.65-67): pads 0.55×0.2 on 3.85 (they were 0.7 long on 4.1), EP 2.8 with 4×1.23 paste (77 %, it was 100 %). Pin 1 is at the left end of the bottom row, with CCW numbering as before. |
| 19 | QFN-48_L7.0-W7.0-P0.50-BL-EP5.1 | GL3224 (U901) | **FIXED** | Genesys GL3224 DS Fig.7.1 (EP 5.1–5.3, b 0.25, L 0.4): lands 0.27×0.8 on 6.8, EP 5.1 with 3×3 paste (~66 %, it was 100 % on 26 mm²). The pinout (Fig.3.1, pin 1 bottom-left, CCW) matches the symbol. |
| 20 | QFN-56_L6.0-W6.0-P0.35--TL-EP4.7 | RTL8156BG (U801) | **FIXED** | Realtek RTL8156BG(S) DS Rev 1.1 §10: EP J=K **4.5 nom (max 4.6)**, b 0.18, L 0.4. The EP copper was 4.7, larger than the package's maximum EP. It is now 4.5 with 2×2 paste (57 %); the file name still says EP4.7. The lands went from 0.15 to 0.2 wide (0.15 gap). Four netless (unnumbered) plated vias in the EP were removed; add GND thermal vias in the paste channels during layout. The pin ring is a 90° rotation of the DS top view (no mirror) and the names match the symbol. |
| 21 | QFN-80_L10.0-W10.0-P0.40-TL-EP3.4 | RP2350B (U1001) | **FIXED** | RP2350 DS Fig.146: pad rows 9.013 / 10.573 (pads 0.78 long, they were 0.665), EP 3.40 with 2×2 1.4 mm paste. Pin 1 is at the top of the left side. Spot-checked the symbol against the DS pin table (GPIO0 = 77, XIN = 30, RUN = 35, GPIO15 = 14). |
| 22 | RJ45-TH_DGUK211Q340CD2A4D2 | Usakro 2.5G magjack (J801) | **FIXED — pin numbering was wrong** | Usakro drawing A0 sheet 1, "Recommended PCB layout viewed from component side". The hole geometry was right but **every pad number was reversed** (signal n ↔ 11−n, LED n ↔ 25−n), which made the footprint a mirrored image of the jack. Pin 1 now sits rightmost in the inner row (nearer the LEDs), with green LED 13/14 on the left and yellow 11/12 on the right, as in the front view. The Ø3.2 posts were plated with zero annular ring and are now NPTH. Shield pads 15/16 (Ø1.7) are kept. Pin functions (sheet 3) match the symbol. |
| 23 | SD-SMD_DM3AT-SF-PEJM5 | Hirose DM3AT (J902) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | Hirose DM3 catalogue p.3 recommended pattern: all 14 pads match (P 1.1, 0.7×1.2, CD-switch pads at 3.7 / 9.9, shell pads at 14.05 / 14.5). SW_B = pad 9 and SW_A = pad 11, as in the drawing. **Layout:** keep traces out of the hatched areas in the drawing (under the switch and card-detect spring). |
| 24 | SD-SMD_SD-111 | Hanbo SD-111 (J901) | **FIXED** | Hanbo SD-111 drawing: contact/WP/CD x positions and sizes match. The peg holes were plated 1.7 with no ring; they are now **NPTH Ø1.50** (pegs are Ø1.35). The drawing puts the side tab pads at hole ±2.75/2.85, 1.4×2.2, while EasyEDA had them about 0.9 mm further in. The pads were widened (2.2/2.1 × 2.2) to cover both positions. Silk trimmed, and the courtyard now includes the body. |
| 25 | SMC_L6.9-W5.9-LS7.9-BI | SMCJ48CA (D102) | **FIXED** | MDD SMCJ DS "Suggested pad layout": pads 4.1×4.3 on 7.9 centres (12.0 overall); the old pads were 3.03×3.82. No polarity marking (bidirectional). |
| 26 | SMC_L6.9-W5.9-LS7.9-RD | SMCJ51A (D101) | **FIXED** | Same land as #25. Pad 1 = cathode band, which matches symbol 1 = C. |
| 27 | SOIC-8_L4.9-W3.9-P1.27-LS6.0-BL | AT24C512C (U103) | **FIXED** (courtyard) | Standard JEDEC SOIC-8: 0.59×1.8 on 5.2, pin 1 bottom-left. Within normal IPC range. |

## Notes for layout
- The regenerated footprints keep the original EasyEDA 3D model reference and pin‑1 location; #2 uses the KiCad
  stock model. #12 has no 3D model.
- `FL_001.kicad_mod` (committed in f6b48b1, not in either review list) is in the legacy `module` format and stops kicad-cli from
  loading the whole `odeck.pretty` library (`fp export svg` fails with "Unable to load library"). Whoever
  imported it should run `kicad-cli fp upgrade`.

# odeck-10 — USB-A sheet (`usb_a.kicad_sch`, ref 700)

Source: `hardware/odeck-10/sheets/usb_a.py`. Two USB 3.2 Gen2 (10 Gbps) Type-A ports on USB7206C hub ports 2 and 3.
Each port has a current-limited VBUS switch that the hub or the RP2350 can turn on, a current-sense amplifier, ESD
protection and VBUS bulk capacitance.

## Choices

### Connector
- **Amphenol GSB4111312HR** (C5429382, 3846 in stock). It is Amphenol's USB 3.1 Gen 2 Type-A family (GSB4), right-angle
  THT. No better-documented in-stock Gen2 Type-A was found (research note: the GSB311/Molex 48406 parts are 5 Gbps only).
- Shell/EH tabs and GND_DRAIN go straight to GND. odeck-10 has no chassis, which matches the usbc_muxes convention.

### Pair naming and AC coupling
- In the Standard-A receptacle pin names (USB 3.2 §5.3), StdA_SSTX (pins 9/8) means the host transmits and StdA_SSRX
  (pins 6/5) means the host receives.
- With hub-view nets, **USBAx_SS_TX* → SSTX pins 9/8** and **USBAx_SS_RX* → SSRX pins 6/5**.
  - The task brief said "hub TX → connector SSRX". That only holds with device-side names, so the sheet follows the
    USB-IF host-side pin names. Check this against the GSB4 drawing when the PDF can be fetched (see open issues).
- AC coupling caps sit on the board of the transmitter they belong to (USB 3.2 §6.2.2, C_AC_COUPLING on the TX side):
  - hub TX: 220 nF on usb_hub (75–265 nF for Gen2);
  - device TX: the caps are inside the plugged device or cable plug, so the SSRX → hub RX path has **no caps here**. Adding
    a second series cap would just put two caps in series, which is wrong.

### Port power switch: TPS2553DBVR (C55266)
- Active-high EN, adjustable current limit, 7.5 ms FAULT# deglitch, reverse-voltage blocking.
- **RILIM = 15.0 kΩ**, the smallest value allowed. From DS table 7.5, the current limit is 1.61 A min, 1.70 A typ and
  1.80 A max (−40…105 °C).
  - The minimum stays above 1.5 A, so BC1.2 DCP/CDP (1.5 A) and the power budget's "7.5 W charge mode" are always
    available.
  - The maximum (1.8 A) is below the GSB4 contact rating class (about 1.8 A per pin) and the 2 A ADC range.
- Input: 10 µF 0805 plus 100 nF at the IN pin. Output: see VBUS bulk.

### Enable logic: hub PRT_CTL OR RP2350 FORCE_EN
- The USB7206C PRT_CTLx pin is both the power enable and the overcurrent sense (integration item 12; usb_hub joins
  `USBAx_PWR_EN` and `USBAx_OCS_N` with 0 Ω R630/R631).
  - Port on: the pin is an input with an internal ~50 kΩ pull-up, so the node is high.
  - Port off or OC latched: the hub drives the pin low.
- **74LVC1G32** (C10096, the same part as on power_input), powered from +3V3:
  - A = USBAx_PWR_EN. This is a CMOS input with no load, so the hub's weak pull-up is enough.
  - B = USBAx_FORCE_EN, which has a 100 kΩ pull-down. The default is off while the RP2350 is in reset or BOOTSEL.
  - Y = TPS2553 EN, with a 100 kΩ pull-down. This keeps the switch off during the +3V3 ramp, when +5V is up and the OR gate
    is unpowered with Ioff high-Z.
- TPS2553 FAULT# (open drain) → USBAx_OCS_N, which is the same node. **No pull-up is added on this sheet.**
- Behaviour:

  | Hub port | FORCE_EN | Overload | Result |
  |---|---|---|---|
  | on | 0 | no | Port powered by the hub |
  | on | 0 | yes | After 7.5 ms FAULT# pulls the node low. The hub sees OC and latches the port off (drives low). The OR output goes low, the switch turns off and FAULT# releases. The hub keeps it off until the host re-enables it. |
  | off | 1 | no | Port powered by the RP2350 (dumb-charge mode, no laptop or no enumeration) |
  | off | 1 | yes | The switch stays in constant-current limit with thermal cycling. FAULT# pulls a node the hub already drives low, so there is no conflict. The RP2350 sees ISENSE pinned at the limit (1.6–1.8 A) and drops FORCE_EN. |
  | on | 1 | yes | The hub reports OC to the host. The port stays current-limited until firmware drops FORCE_EN. |
- The RP2350 can read USBAx_OCS_N directly if the mcu sheet wants to: it is a high-Z GPIO input, and no pull-up may be
  enabled on it.

### Current sense: 30 mΩ + INA180A2 (C192764)
- The shunt sits on the switch input side, between +5V and USBAx_SW_IN. +5V_USBAx therefore stays the real port VBUS
  node, and the switch's 0.1 mA quiescent current is negligible.
- INA180A2 has a gain of 50 and a common-mode range of −0.2 to 26 V regardless of VS, so VS = +3V3 works and the output
  can never exceed the ADC's 3.3 V.
- Scale: 30 mΩ × 50 = **1.5 V/A**.
  - 2.0 A gives 3.00 V, and full scale is 2.2 A (the INA180 swings to VS − 20 mV).
  - The 1.8 A current-limit maximum gives 2.7 V.
- Auto-off threshold: 25 mA gives 37.5 mV.
  - The INA180 offset of ±150 µV × 50 = ±7.5 mV, about ±5 mA. That is fine for a "below about 25 mA for 5 min" rule.
  - The RP2350 ADC is 12-bit, so 0.8 mV is about 0.5 mA per LSB.
- Shunt: Yageo PE0805FRF470R03L (C858599), 30 mΩ, 1 %, 0805, 0.5 W. At 1.8 A it dissipates 97 mW.
- Output: 1 kΩ + 100 nF (fc 1.6 kHz) to the ADC pin. This gives some anti-alias filtering and isolates the INA180 from the
  ADC sampling cap.
- Layout: Kelvin-route IN+/IN− from the inner pad edges of the shunt.

### VBUS bulk
- USB 2.0 §7.2.4.1 asks for ≥ 120 µF of low-ESR capacitance per downstream port. Each port gets:
  - Panasonic **10TPF150ML** POSCAP (C347559): 150 µF, 10 V, 2917, 3275 in stock. The 10 V rating gives 2× margin on 5.1 V.
  - 10 µF 0805 and 100 nF at the connector.
- Inrush into 160 µF is limited by the TPS2553 soft start (about 1 ms ramp, below the current limit). The +5V rail holds
  330 µF polymer plus ceramics (power_rails).

### ESD
- SS lines: **TPD4E02B04** (C106794, 0.25 pF, the same as usbc_muxes), flow-through at the connector, one per port.
- D+/D−: **USBLC6-2SC6** (C7519, about 2.5 pF). VBUS pin 5 on +5V_USBAx, which also clamps the port VBUS. The pin pairs
  1/6 and 3/4 are flow-through.

## Open issues
1. **GSB4111312HR datasheet/footprint.** The Amphenol PDF and the LCSC datasheet could not be fetched (403, no URL). The
   easyeda footprint is named `USB-A-TH_U231-091N-4BLRC19-F1-A`.
   - Before layout, check pad positions and the SSTX/SSRX pin order (5/6 = SSRX, 8/9 = SSTX per USB-IF) against the
     Amphenol drawing.
   - Also confirm the 10 Gbps rating.
2. **TPS2553 footprint.** The import shares `SOT-23-6_L2.9-W1.6-P0.95-LS2.8-BR` with TLV6700DDCR/TLV3011. The import
   script kept the original. Same geometry name, but check it against the TI DBV land pattern.
3. **DCP with no host.** Forcing VBUS on gives power, but a BC1.2/Apple device only draws more than 500 mA if the hub
   presents DCP (D+/D− short) on that port.
   - Whether USB7206C applies its DCP signature on a port whose PRT_CTL is low (hub considers it off) is unverified
     (usb_hub open issue 3).
   - If not, forced mode is limited to non-negotiating loads, or the RP2350 must also enable the port over SMBus.
4. **Firmware.** Drop FORCE_EN when ISENSE sits at the current limit for more than about 100 ms, since the TPS2553 does
   not latch off by itself. Bus-powered mode: keep FORCE_EN off and stay within the budget (power-budget.md).
5. **Thermal.** TPS2553 at 1.7 A × 85 mΩ is about 0.25 W in SOT-23-6. Give the IN/OUT pins copper.

No new inter-sheet nets are needed. The mcu sheet must provide USBA1/2_FORCE_EN as push-pull GPIOs and
USBA1/2_ISENSE as ADC inputs.

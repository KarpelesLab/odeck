# USB-C PD controller selection — odeck-10 (researched 2026-10-02)

[V] = verified in datasheet/vendor page (URL in Sources), [S] = stock/price query 2026-10-02 (JLC parts API,
findchips authorized distis), [I] = inference / to verify on hardware or with vendor.

Ports: **(a)** laptop port — data UFP, power **source** 5–28 V EPR 140 W, DP Alt Mode **UFP_D** (pin C/D), SOP'
e-marker discovery, drives external buck-boost + FETs. **(b)** downstream C — data DFP, source 5 V/3 A,
DP Alt Mode **DFP_D**. **(c)** PD-in — **sink** EPR up to 48 V / 240 W.

## Recommendation

```
 Laptop C (a) ── CC/VBUS ── PMG1-S3 port 0 (EPR src 28 V, UFP_D) ──I2C(private)── buck-boost setpoint
                 SS/SBU ─── TUSB1064 (UFP_D crosspoint, I2C from PMG1)
 Down C   (b) ── CC/VBUS ── PMG1-S3 port 1 (5 V src, DFP_D)
                 SS/SBU ─── TUSB1046-DCI (DFP_D crosspoint, I2C from PMG1)
 PD-in C  (c) ── TPS26750 (EPR sink ≤48 V) + EEPROM + TPD4S480
 RP2350 ── I2C (monitor/request only) ── PMG1-S3 (I2C slave, our command set), TPS26750 (I2C target)
```

1. **Ports (a)+(b): one Infineon PMG1-S3 dual-port, CYPM1322-97BZXI** (or 2× CYPM1311 QFN-48 if the BGA is
   unwanted — then SBU/AUX switching is done by the TUSB parts, and HPD/Attention relay goes over GPIO/I2C).
   - Only sourceable, publicly documented, Active part found that does **EPR source + DP Alt UFP_D** on the same port.
   - Start from Infineon's public `mtb-example-pmg1s3-usbc-dock` (EPR 140 W source on port 0, source on port 1,
     DP alt mode, MP4247/RT6190 buck-boost drivers, signed FW update, billboard). DP passthrough
     (port 1 sink HPD → port 0 Attention/Status) is our application code on top of PdAltMode [I].
   - SOP' discovery / 5 A cable check: in PdStack (standard for EPR source) [I — confirm config flag].
2. **Port (c): TI TPS26750** (as planned). Datasheet: EPR 28/36/48 V sink, boots from ROM + I2C EEPROM [V].
3. **Correction to odeck-10.md:** **TUSB1046-DCI is a *DFP_D* (source-side) redriver** [V] → use it on the
   **downstream** port; the laptop port needs **TUSB1064** (UFP_D sink-side, pin C/D/E) [V].
   JLC: TUSB1064IRNQT 53, TUSB1064RNQT 20; Mouser 242 @ $10.04 [S].

### Safety model (power safety independent of RP2350 firmware)
- PMG1-S3 owns: PDO list (hard-capped in its firmware to what the input stage can deliver, max 28 V),
  provider NFET gate driver, hardware VBUS OVP/UVP/OCP/SCP/RCP comparators [V], and the **buck-boost setpoint
  on its private I2C/feedback** — RP2350 has no electrical path to the buck-boost control.
- RP2350 talks to PMG1 over a narrow I2C command set (status, "set budget ≤ X W"); PMG1 validates and clamps.
- **Reflash gating:** PMG1 flash ships blank, JLC does not pre-program [V, jlcpcb.md] → RP2350 flashes it over
  SWD on first boot (CAT2/PSoC 4 HSSP programming via external MCU, public AN84858 [I]). To stop user firmware
  re-flashing later: PMG1 XRES driven only by POR + a physical button (not an RP2350 GPIO), and PMG1 firmware
  repurposes its SWD pins after boot, so SWD acquire is only possible on blank silicon or with the button held [I —
  verify acquire-window behaviour on CAT2]. Same idea for TPS26750: EEPROM WP held by hardware, released by button.
- Billboard: required when alt mode fails; PMG1-S3 has USB FS device (needs a hub port) or RP2350 emulates it [I].

### External parts (ports a/b)
- 2× back-to-back NFET pairs (common-drain on source path [V]) per port; 5 mΩ VBUS sense resistor per port [V];
  VBUS TVS (≥30 V working for EPR), CC/SBU ESD (TPD4S480-class on all EPR ports; TPD4S480 2881 at JLC [S]).
- TUSB1064 (a), TUSB1046-DCI (b); SPI flash for PMG1 dual-image FW update optional (reference uses one).
- Buck-boost with I2C setpoint or feedback-injection DAC controlled by PMG1 — reference drivers exist only for
  MP4247/RT6190 (≤36 V in); our 9–48 V input needs an LM5177x-class part + new driver [I].

## Risks
- **Closed PdStack library** (Cypress EULA, Cypress-hardware-only): firmware app is open, but the PD stack binary
  is fetched by ModusToolbox, not committed. Acceptable under requirements ("blobs allowed, not committed") [I].
- Dock-UFP_D + DFP_D passthrough on PMG1 is application work; reference dock routes DP to a hub/MST, not to a
  second Type-C port [I]. Plan bring-up time; Infineon PMG1-S3 dock kit useful for prototyping.
- 97-BGA fanout on 6–8 L; JLC handles ≥0.35 mm pitch [V, jlcpcb.md]. QFN-48 ×2 fallback avoids it.
- JLC stock of CYPM1322 is only 50 → consign from Mouser (8095 in stock).
- USB-IF certification not planned; e-marker/EPR-entry interoperability with MacBook Pro M4 Max must be tested.
- VL108 is the cleaner single-chip answer (covers a+b+c incl. 48 V sink) if VIA ever sells it openly — watch.

## 0. Key findings

1. **The LTC4417 cannot take the PD-in rail.** It is specified for 2.5–36 V, with ±42 V protection [V: Newark/ADI
   listing "PowerPath Prioritizer 2.5 to 36 V", https://www.newark.com/analog-devices/ltc4417iuf-pbf/powerpath-prioritizer-qfn-ep-24/dp/51AK7246].
   A 48 V EPR source (50.4 V max) is out of range. **Use discrete ideal-diode controllers (LM74720/LM74800/LM74700),
   with priority set by hardware enable logic.**
2. **The LM5176 has thin margin at 48 V.** It operates up to 55 V, 60 V abs max [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM5176].
   **LM51770** runs 3.5–78 V (85 V abs) and is "bidirectional" [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM51770]. It is in stock
   (JLC 1007, Mouser 2131) and is the preferred buck-boost.
3. **Do not put bus power onto VSYS. Feed it straight onto the 5 V rail.** A laptop sources 5 V (Macs ≈ 15 W), and a
   5 V input cannot go through a buck to make 5 V. Keeping VSYS as an "external power only" rail (9–48 V) also
   makes the source and sink paths simple to interlock.
4. **Thermals are the biggest risk.** At full load, the losses on a bare 100×60 mm board come to about 12–14 W, which
   means a rise of roughly 60–80 K. See §5.
5. **JLC will hand-solder the LCD.** The HS20HS072RX part page says "Assembly Type: Wave Soldering, Standard Only",
   which means operator-soldered. Applying foam tape is **not** a listed service. See §6.

```

- **Priority, enforced in hardware [I].** `pd_ok` comes from a divider and comparator (or the TPS26750 power-good) on
  the PD-in rail after contract. It pulls the LM74720 EN low through an NFET, so the barrel turns off whenever PD-in is
  live. Both paths are ideal diodes, so make-before-break overlap is safe: the higher rail conducts for a moment and
  nothing back-feeds. The logic is powered from each input itself, so no MCU and no always-on rail are needed.
- **`EXT_PRESENT` = VSYS > ~8 V** (comparator or the LM5148 PGOOD).
  - **Sink path (Q4) is allowed only when EXT_PRESENT is low AND the laptop-port PD controller requests sink.**
  - **Source path (Q5) is allowed only when EXT_PRESENT is high AND the PD controller enables source AND the
    buck-boost PGOOD is high.** The source/sink loop (VSYS→buck-boost→VBUS→sink→V5) can then never close.
  - Both are back-to-back pairs, so either one blocks in both directions when off.
- **The bus-power path goes to V5, not to VSYS.** Q4 driven by an LM74800 is both the on/off switch and the reverse
  blocker. While the LM5148 runs (5.1 V), Q4 is held off by EN_SNK. Request **5 V-only sink PDOs** from the laptop, so
  V5 stays within USB-A/LCD limits.
  - Bus-power budget ≈ 15 W in. The deck draws about 4–5 W itself, so the downstream budget is about 8–9 W
    (USB-A limited to 500–900 mA total, downstream C at 5 V/1.5 A or less).
- **Role sequencing on the laptop port.** This belongs to the PD-controller policy, and it needs a dual-role-power
  (DRP) controller with dead-battery support and PR_Swap/FRS (Fast Role Swap) [I].
  - **Attach with no external power:** the deck presents Rd (sink, UFP). Dead-battery mode closes Q4 autonomously.
  - **Attach with external power:** the deck presents Rp. The buck-boost starts at its 5 V default and Q5 closes.
    The deck negotiates SPR/EPR, then does a DR_Swap so it becomes the UFP.
  - **External power arrives while sinking:** V5 is handed to the LM5148 and EN_SNK drops. The PD controller sends
    a **PR_Swap**: the laptop goes to vSafe0V, then the deck sources 5 V, then the contract is raised. If the laptop
    rejects the swap, stay a sink.
  - **External power is lost while sourcing:** VSYS collapses. With FRS (PD 3.x), the laptop takes over 5 V within
    about 150 µs. Size the V5 hold-up caps (several hundred µF) to bridge the gap. Without FRS, the deck resets and
    the USB link drops, re-attaching as a sink. Confirm that the chosen laptop-port PD controller supports FRS and
    that Macs accept PR_Swap from a dock [I].
- **Barrel protection.**
  - LM74720 OV cut-off at about 26.5 V, protecting against a 28–48 V adapter plugged into the barrel.
  - **Bidirectional TVS** with standoff above the OV threshold, so it does not burn if someone plugs in 36–48 V:
    SMCJ33CA, or uni-directional SMCJ33A on the drain side [I].
  - 80 V FETs. Reverse polarity is blocked by the back-to-back pair (−65 V).
- **PD-in protection.** TPD4S480 (already chosen) plus a TVS rated for 48 V EPR: SMCJ58A, C151899 3584 / C409417 2717 [S].

## 2. Buck-boost VSYS (9–50 V) → laptop VBUS (5–28 V, 5 A, 140 W)

| Part | VIN | VOUT | V-set method | JLC [S] | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **LM51770** (HTSSOP-38) | 3.5–78 V, 85 V abs | 3.3–78 V | FB divider + "dynamic output voltage tracking for PWM or analog input" | C43351171 **1007** (Mouser 2131) | Up to 1.8 MHz, average I-limit with IMON, PSM, bidirectional. Drop-in successor to LM5177 [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM51770] |
| LM5177 (HTSSOP-38) | 3.5–60 V, 85 V abs | 3.3–60 V | Same, analog/PWM tracking | C7425536 151 | ≤600 kHz [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM5177] |
| LM51772 (VQFN-40) | 0(3.5)–55 V | 1–55 V | **I2C**, 10/20 mV steps; I-limit 0.5–7 A over I2C; "USB C/PD compatible" | C41383743 **1** (Mouser 33) | Ideal feature set, but no stock and 55 V limit [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM51772] |
| LM5176 (HTSSOP-28) | 4.2–55 V, 60 V abs | 0.8–55 V | FB injection | C442493 **12168** | Cheapest and best stocked. Only 5–10 V margin over a 48 V EPR source [V: https://www.ti.com/product/LM5176] |
| LM5175 | 3.5–42 V [I] | — | FB | C113356 6491 | **Not usable** at 48 V in |
| **BQ25756** (VQFN-36) | 4.2–70 V, 85 V abs | ≤70 V | **I2C**. Reverse (OTG) mode regulates VAC 3.3–65 V, I-limit 0.4–20 A; EPR named | C19272232 **9088** | Bidirectional charger controller, 200–600 kHz [V: https://www.ti.com/product/BQ25756] |
| LT8390 (ADI) | 4–60 V | — | FB | C673802 1766 | ~$12, no advantage |
| TPS55288 | ≤36 V | — | I2C | C2864583 5157 | Integrated, too low VIN/current |

**Can the BQ25756 also do the sink path? Technically yes, but not worth it [I].**
- Wire VAC = laptop VBUS and VBAT = VSYS. Reverse mode then gives an I2C-set PD source, and forward mode could pull
  power from the laptop.
- But the laptop only offers about 5 V/3 A. Boosting that into VSYS and bucking it back to 5 V is wasteful. Forward
  mode is also a battery charger: with no battery, VSYS needs a charge-termination/CV workaround.
- Reverse mode is off at power-up and needs I2C writes to enable (plus watchdog handling). Laptop charging would then
  depend on firmware. Safety would not, because the PD controller's OVP still opens Q5.
- Keep the BQ25756 as a **stocked Plan B to the LM51770** (9k in stock) if I2C control is acceptable.

### Recommended: LM51770, 5 V default, voltage selected by the PD controller in hardware [I]

**Setting the voltage**
- The resistor divider defaults to 5 V (vSafe5V at power-up, with no firmware involved).
- 9/15/20/28 V are selected by **2–3 PD-controller GPIOs** ("voltage select" GPIO events). Each one switches an
  extra FB resistor through a small NFET (2N7002-class). This is the usual TI PD-controller + external-regulator
  scheme. It is MCU-independent and satisfies "power safety must not depend on MCU firmware".
- AVS / fine trim (optional): an RP2350 PWM → RC → resistor injection into FB, with **limited authority** (e.g. ±1 V,
  set by the resistor ratio).
  - Laptops at 140 W use the 28 V fixed PDO, so AVS is not needed for odeck-10.
  - PD transition rules (slew ≤30 mV/µs, ±5%) are handled by soft-start/tracking caps.

**Safety layers [I]**
- The PD controller's VBUS OVP/UVP opens Q5.
- The LM51770 average current limit is set to about 5.5 A on output IMON.
- OVP comparator: a TL431-class part on VOUT_SRC pulls buck-boost EN low above roughly 30 V.

**Efficiency estimate at 140 W out, 250–400 kHz, 2 × 80 V FETs on the input side, 2 × 40–60 V on the output side,

## 3. Housekeeping rails

Load estimate:
- USB-A 3 × 0.9 A (1.5 A BC1.2 CDP on one port) ≈ 3.2 A
- Downstream C 5 V/3 A
- LCD backlight + RP2350 + 3V3/1V2 loads ≈ 1.5 A (at 5 V)
- **Total V5 ≈ 7–8 A (≈ 40 W) worst case.**

| Rail | Recommended | LCSC / stock [S] | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **V5, 8 A from VSYS 9–50 V** | **TI LM5148** 80 V sync buck controller, VQFN-24, 2.2 MHz capable | C7470701 **57474**, $1.16 | 400 kHz, MWSA1004S-3R3 (C408483 501; 11 A / 16 A) + 2 × BSC070N10NS5. η ≈ 93% from 48 V → ≈ 3 W loss [I]. Alternatives: LM5146 (100 V, C3188679 3908), LM5145 (75 V, C485912 2210), dual LM5143-Q1 (65 V, C1849541 452) if V5 is split into ports and system |
| Always-on / aux (optional) | LMR38020 80 V 2 A | C5149193 11594 | Only if a standby rail independent of V5 is wanted |
| USB-A port switches | TPS2553 (adjustable I-limit) | C55266 58742 | Or SY6280AAC C55136 121k (cheap). Per-port FAULT → RP2350 |
| Downstream C 5 V/3 A switch | TPS25946 eFuse or TPS2557 (5 A adj.) | C3662780 1753 / C130056 1942 | Or the downstream PD controller's integrated 5 V switch, if it has one |
| 3V3, ~2–3 A, from V5 | TPS62933 (30 V, 3 A) or TPS563201 (17 V, 3 A) | C3200405 34272 / C116592 114631 | Feeds hub, RTL8156 (internal regulator), GL3224, RP2350, LCD |
| 1V2 / 1V1 (hub core, etc.) | TPS62A02 (2 A) or TLV62569 (2 A) | C5350187 31993 / C141836 242955 | Check per chip: USB72xx core rail, GL3224/RTL8156 internal regulators |
| RP2350 core | Internal SMPS | — | Per RP2350 datasheet |

In bus-powered mode V5 comes straight from Q4, so every rail derived from V5 works unchanged.

## 4. Barrel jack (5.5 × 2.5 mm, ≥8 A)

| Part | LCSC | Stock [S] | Rating (JLC/LCSC listing) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Same Sky (CUI) PJ-063BH** | C3095900 | 240 | 2.5 mm pin, **8 A, 24 V**, THT | Recommended. Mouser 1580, TME 300, Arrow 1246 [findchips] |
| Same Sky PJ-063AH | C22434582 | 491 | 2.0 mm pin, 8 A | 2.0 mm pin, so the wrong size |
| XKB DC-042C-W-2.5 | C480371 | 1340 | 2.5 mm, 8 A, 24 V, right angle | Cheap stocked alternative. Check the datasheet for the pin current rating |
| XKB DC-005R-8A-2.5 | C7433305 | 322 | 8 A, 30 V, right angle | "8A" variant of DC-005 |
| HCTL HC-DC-007B-2.5-G1 | C19270564 | 305 | 2.5 mm, 8 A, 24 V | — |
| Switchcraft RAPC722X | C3095256 | 2 | 5 A | Not enough current |

Notes:
- **2.1 mm compatibility:** a 2.1 mm plug **cannot** go onto a 2.5 mm pin (its bore is too small). A 2.5 mm plug on a
  2.1 mm jack fits loosely and makes poor contact. So one jack cannot serve both; stay with 2.5 mm, which is common on
  high-power laptop bricks, and say so on the silkscreen [I].
- 8 A × 24 V = 192 W. At the 200 W target the jack runs at its limit, so derate the barrel to about 7.5 A in the MCU
  budget policy [I].
- A 24 V contact voltage rating is typical for these jacks. The LM74720 OVP keeps anything above about 27 V off the
  board.

## 5. Thermal budget (bare PCB) [I]

| Source | Worst-case loss |
|---|---|
| Buck-boost at 140 W | 4.5–6 W |
| Input path + source switch + sense resistors | 0.5–1 W |
| V5 buck at 40 W | ~3 W |
| 3V3/1V2 bucks | ~0.5 W |
| Hub + TUSB1046 + RTL8156 + GL3224 + RP2350/LCD | ~3.5–4 W |
| **Total** | **~12–14 W** |

**What this means for a 100 × 60 mm board**
- The board has about 120 cm² of surface across both faces. Natural convection plus radiation gives
  h ≈ 12–15 W/m²K, so θ ≈ 6 K/W for the board as a whole.
- **14 W → about 80 K rise; 10 W → about 60 K.** That is too hot for a desk object, with hot spots higher still.

**Mitigations**
- Spread the power stage over a large inner-plane copper area (2 oz outer layers if JLC offers it on 6/8 layers).
- A bottom aluminium plate on standoffs with a gap pad would roughly double the effective area.
- Grow the board: 120 × 80 mm gives θ ≈ 4 K/W.
- **Thermal derating policy:** an NTC near the buck-boost read by the RP2350, with the laptop contract renegotiated
  from 140 W down to 100/60 W when hot. As a hardware backstop, an NTC on the LM51770 EN/ILIM or a PD-controller
  thermal input.
- Sustained 140 W plus all ports at full load is rare. Design for about 8 W continuous with derating above that.

## 6. JLC assembly questions

**Prices** [V: https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/pcb-assembly-price, https://jlcpcb.com/help/article/pcb-assembly-faqs]

| Item | Price |
|---|---|
| Standard PCBA setup | $25.56 single-sided / $51.12 double-sided |
| Stencil | $8.21 / $16.42 |
| SMT | $0.0016/joint |
| **THT ("wave soldering" parts, actually soldered by hand)** | **$3.58 hand-soldering labour per order + $0.0164/joint**, +1 day |

- Estimate for barrel (3) + RJ45 (~14) + 3 × USB-A Gen2 (~13 each) + LCD tail (~12) + a hybrid USB-C ≈ 80–90 joints,
  which is **about $1.4/board plus $3.58/order [I]**.
- Ask for leads to be trimmed flush, to meet the "no sharp parts on the bottom" goal [I].

**LCD panel**
- The JLC part page for **HS20HS072RX (C5329582, 2208 in stock)** lists "**Assembly Type: Wave Soldering**" and
  "**PCBA Type: Standard Only**" [V: https://jlcpcb.com/partdetail/HS-HS20HS072RX/C5329582]. JLC therefore treats it
  as an operator-soldered part and will solder the FPC tail.
- **Double-sided foam tape:**
  - Not a listed service. The JLC parts category "Double-sided tape" is empty
    [V: https://jlcpcb.com/parts/2nd/Office_Supplies/Double-sided_tape_3230], and "foam tape" returns no stocked part [S].
  - The FAQ and capabilities pages list wire soldering, programming, stacked parts and flex fixtures, but no adhesive
    or mechanical assembly [V: https://jlcpcb.com/capabilities/pcb-assembly-capabilities].
  - → **Ask JLC support** whether they will apply customer-consigned die-cut foam tape (3M 4914-class, 1.1 mm) as a
    special request [I].
  - Plan B: the panel is soldered and the user applies the tape (ship a die-cut pad).
  - Plan C: a locating feature, such as two printed/PCB standoffs or a solder-tab bracket, so the hand-soldered panel
    is positioned without tape.
  - Give JLC an assembly drawing showing the FPC bend direction and the panel outline on silk.

## 8. Risks and open items

1. **Thermal** (§5). This is the biggest risk for "bare-PCB, 140 W" at 100 × 60 mm.
2. **Laptop-port PD controller features.** It must support DRP, dead-battery sink, PR_Swap and ideally FRS, and drive
   two back-to-back gate pairs (Q4/Q5) or accept external gate drivers. This depends on open question 1 in
   odeck-10.md.
3. **Stock depth.** LM51770 (1007), LM74720 (776), 2.5G magjack (111), PJ-063BH (240). Pre-order into the JLC library.
   Fallbacks: BQ25756 (9088), LM74800 (10k), DC-042C-W-2.5 (1340).
4. **LM51770 DTRK/tracking pin details, and GPIO-switched FB transient behaviour (overshoot when stepping
   28 V → 5 V)** need datasheet review and simulation. Add an active VBUS discharge (bleeder FET) on VOUT_SRC for
   fast down-transitions [I].
5. **48 V creepage/rating everywhere on VSYS.** Use ≥100 V caps, or 80 V with derating, and 80 V FETs. The TVS
   clamp must stay below the FET V(BR).
6. **Foam tape** not confirmed (§6). Ask JLC support before layout freezes the area under the panel.
